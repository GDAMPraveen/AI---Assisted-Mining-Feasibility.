# ⛰️ AI-Assisted Mining Feasibility & Environmental Risk Assessment  
*(Student Project)*

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning and AI-based reasoning** can be used to assess whether **mining should be allowed in a given region**, based on environmental, climatic, socio-economic, and infrastructural factors.  
The system also explains **why mining is allowed or restricted** and highlights **potential environmental consequences**.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

- **Manual Input:** Enter regional parameters such as forest cover, rainfall, seismic zone, and protected status.
- **CSV/Excel Upload:** Upload a file containing multiple regions for batch analysis.
- **Prediction:** The model classifies whether mining is **Allowed** or **Not Allowed**.
- **AI Explanation:** An AI agent provides justification and environmental risk insights.
- **Download Results:** Export predictions as a CSV file.
